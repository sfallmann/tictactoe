## Implementation

### Dependencies
Node.js, npm, Lodash, Express

### Installation
Clone repo
Install node and npm.
Run "npm install" from the cli

### A quick note
This can work completely from the browser with no real modifications. I'm using Lodash via the browser
since this was for a frontend dev project. All you need is the contents of the public folder.

Be aware - running locally will not work due to a cross origin issue loading grid.svg from the file system.
That's why I used Express to run a local server.

The game logic can allow for two human players and two computer players.  The ui just hasn't been built to accomdate yet.

I plan on implement the following in the near future:
  Animating the board components and buttons
  Adding sound when the tokens and board are "drawn"
  Two player hotseat\internet (using socket.io)
